# Exploratory Data Analysis on Country Emissions

## Overview

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on global fossil CO2 emissions by country from 2002-2022. The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022).

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Year`: the year of the emission data
- `Country`: the country that emitted the CO2
- `CO2 Emissions (tonnes)`: the amount of CO2 emissions in tonnes

## Data Cleaning

Before performing any analysis, the dataset needs to be cleaned. The following steps will be taken:

- Check for missing values
- Check for duplicates
- Check for outliers
- Check for inconsistent values

## Data Analysis

The following analyses will be performed:

- Total CO2 emissions by country
- CO2 emissions by year
- Top 10 countries with the highest CO2 emissions
- CO2 emissions by continent

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into global fossil CO2 emissions by country. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle, and it has been cleaned and analyzed. The analyses performed provide insights into the total CO2 emissions by country, CO2 emissions by year, top 10 countries with the highest CO2 emissions, and CO2 emissions by continent.
